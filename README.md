# Description

Recommendation Systems are everywhere from <strong>Youtube</strong> recommending similar videos, from <strong>Netflix</strong> recommending similar movies to <strong>Spotify</strong> recommending songs according to our interests. In short a recommendation system is an algorithm focussed at suggesting relevant recommendations to a user based on past preferences of the user or suggesting relevant data to the user based on the itemâ€™s features. There are two paradigms of recommender systems: Collaborative and Content Based methods. I created this recommendation system using Content based method. I used the details of the movie like cast and crew, genres, overview of the movie to predict the recommendations for the user.
